I/O performance is critical to productivity for data-intensive
scientific computing, but it is notoriously difficult to understand
and diagnose. This problem is exacerbated by an ongoing trend towards
deeper I/O hierarchies and more complex I/O architectures. Capturing
and visualizing system-wide performance telemetry is a key step towards
solving this problem, but is only a partial solution because it continues to
hinge upon specialized human expertise to identify and interpret problems
and turn raw data into actionable intelligence.

In this work we explore how algorithmic methods can be used to ease the
burden of extracting actionable insight from long-running production
instrumentation using a full year of telemetry from two leading HPC
facilities as test cases.  In doing so, we answer the following questions:
Does intuition and methodology derived from individual application
anecdotes match the reality of long-term production behavior? How do we
detect critical inflection points in performance?  How do we assess the
scope and contributing factors for a given a performance inflection point?
Can underlying trends be identified beyond the noise of day-to-day
performance variability?

We find that \TODO{...}
