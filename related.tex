\section{Related Work}

Several recent studies have contributed techniques to combine
system-wide HPC instrumentation data for integrated
analysis~\cite{Lockwood2017,Vazhkudai2017guide,Agelastos2014ldms,Kunkel2014siox}
. Vazhkudai et. al notably used a Splunk data warehouse to analyze system
logs and perform operational analytics on a large-scale storage system.
The cloud computing community has also identified the need to to unify
analysis capabilities across diverse environments. The Dapper system
developed by Sigelman et. al combines comprehensive tracing with a novel
sampling method to observe critical paths in large cloud environments in great
detail~\cite{Sigelman2010dapper}.

Di et. al~\cite{7973730} and Park et. al~\cite{Park2017BigDM} have
investigated how to perform correlation analysis on HPC log data once it has been
collected.  Their analyses included compute and network resources, with a
particular emphasis on event logs.

Several researchers have documented 
I/O performance variability anecdotes on leadership-scale
systems~\cite{Lofstead2010,Yildiz2016,carns2011understanding} and proposed
methods to combat it.  

Our work builds upon best-in-class previous efforts by combining system
monitoring, application monitoring, and explicit performance probing
into a portable, holistic framework without the need for additional database
infrastructure, and by introducing methods to help automate the task
of deriving actional insight from these data sources.
