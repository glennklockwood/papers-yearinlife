\section{Conclusion}

\TODO{Go for some really strong conclusions here.  Refer back to the
abstract and introduction and either respond assertively to the
questions/contributions we listed there, or prune them out.  We would like
to have some outcome that is stronger than ``we analyzed some data and found
X''}

\TODO{What are implications for state of practice?  Was particular
instrumentation notably helpful or unhelpful?  What's the next step for what
we've shown here?}
