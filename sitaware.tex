\section{Situational Awareness}

When collecting large volumes of production data from multiple layers of the
I/O subsystem, it quickly becomes important to distill this data into a more
digestable holistic overview.

\TODO{Things that are important here: behavior over time, grouping data
sources in a way that helps understand scope, focusing on fundamental
\emph{changes} in performance rather than steady state, everything in one
view}.

\TODO{Introduce the overview figure, whether it is a heatmap or something
else.  Can be a very big figure. Annotate regions of interest that we can refer to later}
