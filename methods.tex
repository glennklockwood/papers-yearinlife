\section{Experimental Platform}

We ran the benchmarks described in~\cite{Lockwood2017} for a period of one year on Mira and Edison.

\TODO{Describe Mira and Edison.  Briefly summarize instrumentation sources
etc, but lean on PDSW paper for details.  We won't have space to be
exhaustive here and at some point we want ``We used TOKIO'' to gain traction
as shorthand for what we are doing.}

\TODO{Be sure to point out some anecdotes about the volume of data collected
(in total) over the year.  How many darshan logs, how many benchmark runs,
etc.}
