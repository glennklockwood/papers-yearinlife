\subsection{Statistical overview} \label{sec:features/summary}

% \TODO{Things that are important here: behavior over time, grouping data sources in a way that helps understand scope, focusing on fundamental \emph{changes} in performance rather than steady state, everything in one view.}

Absolute I/O performance is influenced by many factors, most notably (a)
application I/O pattern, (b) read/write ratio, and (c) I/O system
architecture~\cite{Lockwood2017, Xie2012}.  This makes it difficult to
reason about performance variation across benchmarks or across platforms,
because each combination is capable of a different baseline performance
level.  We
address this problem by normalizing the
performance of each of the 11,986 observations in terms of its
\emph{fraction of peak performance}.
The fraction of peak performance is defined as the absolute performance (in
bytes/sec) of an observation divided by the maximum absolute performance
observed across all jobs with a common (a), (b), and (c) above.  This
approach allows us to focus on variability for different classes of I/O
workloads rather than their relative performance.

The distribution of the fraction of peak performance measurements for four
of the five systems tested is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:summary-boxplots}.
This figure illustrates that the performance of active I/O performance
probes on production file systems is highly dynamic over the course of a
year.  It does not provide any insight into the temporal nature of the
performance fluctuations, however.

Figure~\ref{fig:summary-heatmap} visualizes the same data in the form of a
heatmap over time.  This shows that performance variation is not randomly
distributed over the year; a key characteristic that is not captured by
time-independent performance distributions.
Several archetypical forms of correlated performance degradation observed in Fig. \ref{fig:summary-heatmap} are highlighted in Fig. \ref{fig:summary-heatmap} and fall into three broad categories of variation:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Dark vertical bands, exemplified in the \mira data in Fig. \ref{fig:regions-heatmap}, represent transient system-wide issues that resulted in a uniform loss of performance for all applications tested that day.
\item Dark horizontal bands, shown in the \cori data, indicate a long-term degradation in performance that disproportionately affects a specific I/O motif.
\item Isolated dark blocks represent individual application runs where performance was poor for a very short period of time within a day.
\end{enumerate}

% - Baseline performance and variability are not constant over time.  Predictive models must therefore adapt over time as well.
The preponderance of these time-dependent phenomena underscore the observation that \textbf{baseline I/O performance and variability are not constant over time}, and
what may qualify as abnormally poor performance during one period of time may be the baseline performance expectation during another.

This has implications for both HPC facility operators and users.  For
facility operators, it indicates that performance anomolies and their root
causes should not be assessed in isolation. By integrating broader spatial and
termporal context into the analysis, facility operators can more accurately
discrinate between applciation problems and environmental factors.
% From Phil: In the prose we can site several predictive model papers (Bing Xie's papers, Sandeep's papers, and others) and point out that the implication is that these models aren't just "set it and forget it."  Not knocking them or even saying they can't do it, but just pointing out it's not covered yet.
For users and application developers, it follows that the accuracy of parameterized I/O performance models~\cite{Xie2012,Madireddy2017} will degrade unless they are reparameterized as the I/O subsystem they model evolves.
Both of these cases justify the need for a systematic approach for identifying different regions of I/O performance to differentiate long-term factors and phenomena from short-term transients.

\subsection{Time-dependent analysis} \label{sec:features/timedependent}

Section~\ref{sec:features/summary} clearly illustrates the presence of
time-varying behavior, but quantitative methods are needed to extract 
actionable insight from these observations.  The main challenge that these
methods face is differentating performance trends from individual short-term
fluctuations in timeseries data.
This problem is not unique to I/O performance or even computer science,
however.  Notably, financial market technical analysis techniques are
routinely used for a similar purpose: attenuating day-to-day volatility in
the price of assets and identifying price movement
trends~\cite{james1968monthly,gunasekarage2001profitability}.  

The most straightforward initial technique to apply from this domain is
the use of Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) over the performance observations.
Given a time window of width $w$, the SMA for performance at time $t$ is the arithmetic mean of the fraction peak performance over ${-0.5w <= t < +0.5w}$.
When chosen to be sufficiently short (${w_{short} \sim O(\textup{days})}$),
the resulting $\textup{SMA}_{short}$ provides a rapid visual means to
identify performance degradation or recovery that lasts for
$O(\textup{days})$.  Multiple SMAs can be plotted simultaneously over the
same data set to differentiate short and long term trends and identify key
crossover points. In the context of financial markets, SMAs (and other more
sophisticated related techniques) are used for predictive purposes to time
the execution of market trades.  In the context of I/O performance
monitoring they more readily applicable to identifying regions of interest in past
behavior rather than predicting future behavior.

To address this need for systematic partitioning of performance regions, we apply Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) to the data collected from active I/O performance.
Given a time window of width $w$, the SMA for performance at time $t$ is the arithmetic mean of the fraction peak performance over ${-0.5w <= t < +0.5w}$.
When chosen to be sufficiently short (${w_{short} \sim O(\textup{days})}$), the resulting $\textup{SMA}_{short}$ provides a rapid visual means to identify performance degradation or recovery that lasts for $O(\textup{days})$.

An example of an SMA ($w_{short}$ = two weeks) applied to the performance data collected from HACC tests run on \cori is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries-baseline}.
When contrasted with a time-independent summary statistic such as the overall mean performance of the entire year, the SMA clearly identifies the long period of degraded HACC write performance on \cori that was qualitatively shown in the bottom half of Fig. \ref{fig:summary-heatmap}.
The points at which the SMA rise above or below the global mean performance also provide quantitative measurements of the region of time when an underlying issue manifested;
in Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries-baseline}, these \emph{crossover points} fall on March 24 and August 10.
Cross-referencing these dates with the service history of \cori retrospectively revealed that the beginning and end of this long-term region of divergent performance coincided with major system software upgrades that also happened on March 24 and August 10.

Curiously, the performance of HACC read workload (Figure \ref{fig:timeseries-baseline}b) was unaffected during this time, demonstrating that not all workloads are affected by long-term variation equally.
This asymmetry, in combination with the bounding dates of this divergent region, allowed us to trace this specific issue to unintentional behavior introduced (and later fixed) in the Lustre software running on \cori during the system upgrades.
Although this particular case of long-term performance divergence was caused by an unexpected bug in system software, the reality of most production storage systems is that they are regularly patched and upgraded.
At minimum, the security requirements of the centers which run them drive system updates, and as exemplified by the widely publicized Spectre and Meltdown patches, such updates can have non-trivial effects on certain types of I/O.
Thus, \textbf{administrative activities such as maintenance patches and
software updates represent a significant source of time-dependent, long term performance
variation.}  This must be accounted for in both retrospective performance
analysis and forward looking performance modeling parameterization.  The
ramifications I/O research practitioners is that \textbf{holistic I/O monitoring
should incorporate environmental provinence
information, such as kernel version, operating system version, and file
system version in the data set to aid in correlation.}  We also observe that
\textbf{existing work in financial market analysis can be applied to
time-varying performance data to attenuate noise and identify underlying
trends.}

\subsection{Partitioning divergent behavior} \label{sec:features/partitioning}

The above performance analysis, enabled by comparing a short-range SMA to a long-range summary statistic, can be generalized by superimposing a second SMA ($\textup{SMA}_{long}$) with a longer window (${w_{long} \sim O(\textup{weeks})}$) on top of $\textup{SMA}_{short}$ (which captures variations ${O(\textup{days})}$).
Doing so allows us to examine short-term performance variations (e.g., a period of sustained bandwidth contention) in the context of longer-term trends (e.g., in the presence of a file system software regression) and determine the causes of variation \emph{within} different regions of divergence such as the period described in Section \ref{sec:features/timedependent}.
The points at which $\textup{SMA}_{short}$ intersects $\textup{SMA}_{long}$, termed \emph{crossover points}, also conveniently establish the boundaries of regions where short-term performance has diverged from longer-term performance and anomalous performance is prevailing.
We therefore introduce the notion of \emph{divergence regions} which are the periods of time bounded by two crossover points and capture correlated performance.

For the remainder of this study, we apply the concept of \emph{divergence regions}, bounded by the crossovers between $\textup{SMA}_{short}$ and $\textup{SMA}_{long}$, to systematically identify and characterize periods in time where anomalous performance was observed by the active I/O probes running across all of the test systems.
We define $\textup{SMA}_{short}$ to have $w_{short} = 2 \textup{ weeks}$ as in \ref{sec:features/timedependent} and $\textup{SMA}_{long}$ to have $w_{long} = 7 \textup{ weeks}$.
$w$ was chosen to be a multiple of seven days to align with the U.S. work week and ensure that weekends and weekdays were equally represented both SMA calculations.
That said, our choice of $w_{long} = 7 \textup{ weeks}$ was somewhat arbitrary, and the analysis and conclusions presented below were insensitive to changes of $\pm 1 \textup{ week}$.
