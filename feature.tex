\section{Feature detection and contributing factors}

\TODO{How do we identify cases where performance is diverging in a
significant, sustained way?  Slowly worse, worse at at once, improving etc.}

\TODO{Once we've found these regions, how do we then find the factors that
contributed to that behavior?}

\TODO{This is where we introduce methodology for flagging regions,
identifying key point, running umami, binning likely contributors, etc.}

\TODO{Somewhere, maybe not here, revisit findings from PDSW paper and see if
they still make sense in year long context?}
